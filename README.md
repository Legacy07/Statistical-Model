A statistical model using numerical integration which involves standard normal distribution; 

Able to calculate and display the area,  
display a graphical representation of the area and
calculate and display the normal distribution table. 

However bear in mind that the graphical representation of the area isn't quite 100% functional.

In order to output the result; 

input sensible mean and standard deviation then select one of the four different types. 
Finally select one of the three rule from the drop down list to accurately calculate the area. 

You can go online to compare the results to see how accurate it is which the simpsons rule is the most accurate.
Based on the result the graph will paint the area and also you can check the values in a table.
